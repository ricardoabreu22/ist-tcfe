\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building and analysing an Audio Amplifier Circuit, made of a gain stage and an output stage, has been achieved. The theoretical analysis was performed with the help of the Octave math tool and the circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. For both analysis, we determined the gain and input and output voltages of the circuit, as well as, lower cut-off frequency. We also plotted the frequency responce Vo(f)/Vi(f). At the end, we calculate the merit of our work.

This way, in theoretical analysis, we explained why the two stages could be connected without significant signal loss. And, in simulation analysis, we also explaneid the purpose of the coupling capacitors and their effect on the bandwidth, the purpose of the bypass capacitor and its effect on the gain and the effect of resistor RC on the gain.

 As previously mentioned, the simulation results had slight differences from the theoretical ones. However, we designed an acceptable Audio Amplifier Circuit - furthermore, we obtained a decent figure of merit, despite the cost being too high.
