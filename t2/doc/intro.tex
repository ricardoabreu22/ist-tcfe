% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
AC voltage source $v_s$, seven resistors, a voltage-controlled current source $I_b$, a capacitor $C$
and a current-controlled voltage source $V_d$. The components of this circuit are distribuited 
by 4 elementary meshes and 8 nodes, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}. 

In order to analyse the circuit, the following data were obtained by running the supplied Python script: 

\textit{Units for the values:} V, A, F, Ohm and S\par
\textit{Values:}

\end{table}

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit, 
performed on Octave, is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the 
circuit is analysed by simulation, using NGSpice, and the results are compared to 
the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions 
of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
