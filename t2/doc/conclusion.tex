\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a RC circuit by determining its natural and forced solution has been achieved. The theoretical analysis was performed with the help of the Octave math tool and the circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. In both analysis, we had to determine the operating point results for t$<$0 and t=0, and then apply the results obtained previously to plot the solutions, which were the time fuction of $v_6$, $v_s$ and the voltage in the capacitor $C$ and the respective frequency fuctions of their magnitudes and phases. The simulation results matched the theoretical results accurately - furthermore, because we use the time interval [-5;20]ms for the theoretical analysis, we can notice the discontinuities of some voltage values, which were previously explained in this report.
