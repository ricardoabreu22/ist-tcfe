\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a circuit with resistors, voltage sources and current sources by applying the Nodal and Mesh methods together with Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws and Ohm's Law has been achieved. The theoreticall analysis was performed with the help of the Octave math tool and the circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results perfectly. This happens mainly because the method used to obtain the theoretical results is the same method Ngspice uses to emulate the  described circuit. Another reason why the results match perfectly is that the circuit was composed by simple components.For more complex components, the theoretical and simulation models may differ but it is not the case in this assignment.
