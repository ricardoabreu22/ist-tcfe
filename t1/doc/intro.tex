% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
DC voltage source $V_a$, seven resistors, a voltage-controlled current source $I_b$ and
a current-controlled voltage source $V_c$. The components of this circuit are distribuited 
by 4 elementary meshes and 8 nodes, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}. 

In order to analyse the circuit, the following data were obtained by running the supplied Python script: 

\textit{Units for the values:} V, mA, kOhm and mS
\textit{Values:} 

R1 = 1.00147062639\par
R2 = 2.0078068512\par
R3 = 3.11269704405\par
R4 = 4.10609573471\par
R5 = 3.02670672634\par
R6 = 2.01292455078\par
R7 = 1.02905244808\par
Va = 5.24842063411\par
Id = 1.04086013403\par
Kb = 7.21413591579\par
Kc = 8.01455113996


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit, performed on Octave
using the mesh and node methods, is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the 
circuit is analysed by simulation, using NGSpice, and the results are compared to 
the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions 
of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
