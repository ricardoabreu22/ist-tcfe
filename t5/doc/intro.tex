% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to simulate a Band Pass Filter (BPF) using OPAMP as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.
We should have a central frequency of 1KHz and a 40 dB gain at the central frequency. 

This way, we should choose its the architecture, considering the limitations imposed as well as the cost of the components in the circuit.
Its diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

This circuit is composed by 6 resistors, 3 capacitors and a 741 OPAMP.
The values of the components are exhibited in the table below.

Notice that some components have been simplified by its equivalent ($R_1$, $R_3$, $R_4$ and $C_2$).

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit, 
performed on Octave, is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the 
circuit is analysed by simulation, using NGSpice, and the results are compared to 
the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions 
of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
