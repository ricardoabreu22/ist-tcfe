In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an AC/DC converter, made of an envelope detector and a voltage regulator, has been achieved. The theoretical analysis was performed with the help of the Octave math tool and the circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. For both analysis, we plotted the output voltages of both the envelope detector and voltage regulator and, in the case of the regulator, we also determine the maximum, minimum and average output voltage, so we could measure the voltage ripple and difference between the output and 12V, to calculate the figure of merit. The simulation results matched the theoretical results accurately - furthermore, we obtained a low stabilization time and a decent figure of merit, despite the cost being too high.
